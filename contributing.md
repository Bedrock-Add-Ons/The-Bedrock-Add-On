Thanks for contributing to the add-on. Please note the below phases, implementation details, and systems guidelines *before* contributing.

# Phases
Development of the add-on is divided into progressive phases to ensure some coherence… at least early on. No timetable is set on phase length. The current phase is **Phase 1**.

## Phase 1: Tweaks
Only small tweaks will be accepted in Phase 1. Example tweaks include:

- Entity health, damage, and drops
- Spawn rules
- Structure loot
- Trading
- Recipe adjustments
- Non-gameplay mob variants

The player definitions may not be altered in this phase.

## Phase 2: Reworks & New Mobs
Phase 2 opens up much more than Phase 1:

- New blocks, items, and mobs will be accepted.
- Existing entities, including the player, may be heavily reworked.
- Scripting systems 

Note that core game progression (portal ⃯→ Nether fortress → stronghold → Ender dragon) may not be affected.

## Phase 3: Game Rework
In this final phase, *nothing* is off limits, including core game progression.

# Implementation Notices
A few details implementation details should be noted:

- The add-on minimum engine version will always be kept up-to-date.
- Definition format versions must be (amongst) the newest available.
- Experimental features are not yet available. They may be made available in Phase 2 following community consensus.
- All interfaces must be available in the release client. Systems using interfaces only available to Preview will be rejected.

# System Guidelines
A few systems may have particular guidelines in the future depending on contributor requests…
